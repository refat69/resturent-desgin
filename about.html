        <h2>About us</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to Garden palace – Dhaka’s one and only fine seafood
          restaurant! Garden palace presents scintillating Continental & Asian
          recipes that will stimulate the palate of the fussiest of gastronomes.
          Garden palace basks in pride on the freshness of its products., each,
          prepared with choice seafood, fresh vegetables and accompanying
          ingredients. OPEN ALL DAY! EVERYDAY!
        </p>
        <p>
          Many years ago, when Garden palace first opened its doors, the seafood
          dining scene in Dhaka was more or less non-existent, today. Garden
          palace is an iconic eatery and often the first choice of seafood
          connoisseurs in our city.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having moved into new premises recently, it continues to follow the
          same gusto for seafood and the pandemic won't bog that down, with
          policies such as wearing masks and social distancing maintained in
          order to protect the staff and customers alike, operations continue.
        </p>
        <p>
          As opposed to those large complexes housing numerous eateries and
          other institutions, Garden palace feels cosy, being in a single-unit
          building. It allows to 'give a particular character to a restaurant.
          As you step inside, the marine and fish themed decor -- from fish
          motifs on the walls, to decorative instruments and objects of the ship
          like the anchor, to even miniature 'boats' fashioned as lamps.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the appetite for seafood kicked in, the menu will then offer you
          a wide plethora of delicacies to satisfy the palate. Garden palace
          shall spoil you with choices. There are myriad soups and starters to
          pick from. The kebabs and koftas will continue to delight your taste
          buds. From Grilled Lobster to King Crab, and from 'Pesto- Pangash!' to
          'Totally Tilapia!', and be it salmon or more exotic delicacies, Garden
          palace has it covered. With fish-steaks, sizzlers, fillets, and pastas
          and so on, the eatery will not let you down.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dish of scallops and shrimps was by itself large enough. With
          salad and fried rice on the side, the centre stage is occupied by a
          potato 'basket' containing, of course, scallops and shrimps, along
          with mushrooms (lots of it, thankfully) and other goodies. A
          flavorsome, spicy, and filling treat! Accompanied by their mock tails
          or fresh juices, and finishing it all off with desserts, Garden palace
          will live up to its name.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may opt for our catch-of-the-day, which a treat of whole fish
          cooked to your liking, with a range of styles and options to choose
          from. On the other hand, we also serve surf and turf dishes -- great
          if your loyalty is torn between meat and seafood, that is. However,
          leaned towards seafood, and in came Scallops & Shrimp Lagniappe, after
          trying out their deliciously tangy and hot Tom Yam Kung.
        </p>
